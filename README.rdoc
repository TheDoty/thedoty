Pretty simple website.

The blog is straightforward MVC rails.  Authoring is via the rails console for now; Post.author creates a new post allowing you embed photos via the text photo:id.

The photos section is likewise simple at the moment.  Add via the bin/add_photo.sh script.

The favorites section is pretty neat: all AngularJS with the rails backend just server up JSON and loading the angular files.  Check out app/assets/javascript/favorites/*.js and public/partials for most of the non-obvious files.
